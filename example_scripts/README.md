**Human Confusion Dataset** 

The dataset can be downloaded from the link below.

https://github.com/kailasdayanandan/dual_thinking/releases/download/v0.0.1-dataset-release/human-confusion-dataset.0.1.zip


**Code details**

Unzip the dataset from link above. 

Move folder images, masks, and other csv files to the data folder.

The below code can be used to reproduce the results.

```
python main_release.py
```

We have uploaded the files generated by mmdetection for different models.
The files in the output folder can be generated by running the below code for different models.

```
python mmdetection_evaluate.py
```
