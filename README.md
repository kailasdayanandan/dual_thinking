### Code details

Create a folder named data and unzip the dataset from link above. Move folder images, masks, and other csv files to the data folder.

The below code can be used to reproduce the results.

```
python main_release.py
```

We have uploaded the files generated by mmdetection for different models.
The files in the output folder can be generated by running the below code for different models.

```
python mmdetection_evaluate.py
```
