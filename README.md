# Dual Thinking and Perceptual Analysis of Deep Learning Models using Human Adversarial Examples

## Human Confusion Dataset

The human confusion dataset can be downloaded from the link below.

https://github.com/kailasdayanandan/dual_thinking/releases/download/v0.0.1-dataset-release/human-confusion-dataset.0.1.zip

### Running code

A folder data can be created and the contents of the zip file (data, masks, and other csv files) mentioned above can be moved to the folder.

The below code can be used to reproduce the results.

```
python main_release.py
```

We have uploaded the files generated by mmdetection for different models.
The files in the output folder can be generated by running the below code for different models.

```
python mmdetection_evaluate.py
```
